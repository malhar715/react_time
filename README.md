# Reaction Time Game
Begin by selecting the difficulty (easy, medium, hard). A random series of colors will appear on the screen for a couple seconds (number of colors depends on difficulty). Click on the green color to measure reaction time. Game lasts for 10 rounds, then the reaction time for each round is averaged.
